            <p> Morose faces when you enter
                Their eyes show wha's in their hearts
                Feelings of contempt for both you and themselves
                Something you cannot help
                Stubborn thoughts imposed upon you
                Daily examples of immorality
                Injustice exposed but not confronted
                Believing based only on sight, thinking they're right
                But it's the blind leading the blind and it seems to be genetic
                Misinformation quckly spreading
                cuz the virus goes undetected
                What they want most is 
                for their illness to be accepted
            </p>
