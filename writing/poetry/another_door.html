                Another Door
            </h1>
            <p> From one place to another 
                I move with the wind of my emotions
                the consequences of my actions
                I close the doors I choose to not walk through
                but I sometimes wish I didn't have to walk through another.
                
                Let me sit in this room for a little bit longer
                let me enjoy these people for who they are
                let us grow together, improve each other 
                let us rejoice in the blissful melodies of each other's voices
                i want to fall into your hugs, sink into your affection forever.

                I make a mistake and a new door appears
                hesitating as I peer back at my peers. 
                I'll miss all the things we discussed, played, and laughed at together. 
                In this world, beautiful things don't last forever. 
                Those brief moments are what I'll think about as I draw my last breath
                Falling through the timelines before my death. 

                Thank you for giving a shallow heart some depth. 
            </p>
