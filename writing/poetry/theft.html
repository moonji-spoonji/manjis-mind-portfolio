                Theft
            </h1>
            <p> Give me what is mine
                Take what is yours
                We both have something we can’t return
                Your stole from me 
                I stole from you 
                Each heart beats for the other
                A statement no longer true. 
                
                Truth: something you kept to yourself
                What i needed most when i asked for help
                To understand and mend the cracks in the ship
                But you holding back set us down to sink.
                All our love, now on on the ocean floor
                Too deep, too dark for one to explore
                Laid to rest forevermore 
                But you know there’s still a crack in the door
                
                You robbed my mind
                You robbed my chest
                You robbed my life 
                of all my loneliness. 
                
                We took a chance 
                On what's labeled love
                You stole my hand
                And flew me to the gardens above.                 
                
            </p>
