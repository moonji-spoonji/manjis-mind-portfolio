                Little Prince & Me
            </h1>
            <p>
                Let's drink milk on the moon 
                and race 'round Saturn's rings.
                We can jump from star to star 
                I'll be flower, and you the little prince.

                Even if i lose my eyes, 
                my heart would always know you.
                I live quite wel with my sight
                but my feelings are expressions of truth.

                So if your body gets too heavy,
                we'll grow roots when it grows windy.
                People on express trains travel fast
                but we move where we want at a pace so steady.

                And don't you worry on that day,
                At any time, we can fly home on the pilot's plane.
                As long as we're together, we can learn to love change
                for I know that everything will be okay.
            </p>
