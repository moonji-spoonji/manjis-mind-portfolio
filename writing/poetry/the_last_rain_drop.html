                The Last Rain Drop
            </h1>
            <p> All my friends left and I'm the last one to follow.
                I'm new to this place and I'm scared to be alone.

                What if I fall outside the puddle?
                Wat if I get trapped in someone's gutter?
                What if the wind blows me in the other direction?
                What will i do when all the rain drops I see are ones I never knew?

                But I kept falling and felt this light inside me.
                The sun shone so very brightly
                and my Cloud said, 
                "All rain drops, no matter where you may be.
                are family and friends I'm eager for you to meet.
                And if you ever feel alone, 
                remember you always return back to me."

                So I fall with faith that everything will be alright
                because where I land I will land and I cannot change that.

                Whether I'm  a drop in a puddle or an ocean,
                or stream from a cup of tea, 
                from a rain drop I started 
                and back to my Cloud I will be. 
            </p>
