                Daisies II
            </h1>
            <p> What more could i want
                Than sleep in a garden 
                Where daisies give hugs to everyone who walks in
                
                Dreaming of peace and
                Seeing beauty in everything
                Intelligent design is nothing less than amazing.
                
                Eternal smile from passing a temporary test 
                Ending heartbreak, desiring rest
                The world is blind to the next life
                Unimaginable relief and ease
                What they feel is all they can believe 
                Cuz all they focus on is their own strife 
                But ignore the terror they soon will face
                Melted skin, scorching water to drink 
                Severe torture cuz right now they’d rather not think 
                Of the eternal future, they’re absorbed in the illusive instant.
