                Wake Up
            </h1>
            <p> A dream is a dream and nothing more. 
                Open your eyes my dear, close that door. 
                Reality begs for your presence here
                A life is not lived in the mind, i fear
                
                Happiness is more than a moment or a while
                Just as joy is not shown only by a smile.
                Sure it’s nice to think of worlds with cotton candy trees
                But fantasies create fanatics of things that will never be. 
                
                Disappointment then leads to self-induced depression
                Since expectations were raised by your artistic expression
                Pessimism attached to all your world views
                This is the delusion resulting from the path you might choose.
                
                Open your eyes and live in the world around you
                If you grope for what lies in the dark, you’ll have nothing to hold on to.                
                
            </p>
