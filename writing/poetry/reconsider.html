                Reconsider
            </h1>
            <p> The edge is here, where your toes hang off
                soon torn skin, once baby soft
                had life lived, and long love lost
                no joy left, so now you drop
                But you know that I care, and I always have
                you know that I listen and I have your back
                I'd take your sadness and give you my heart
                and you wouldn't force the end, we'd just press restart. 
                If only you knew when bones crush, they don't turn to glitter
                And if you cared about me, you would reconsider. 
            </p>
