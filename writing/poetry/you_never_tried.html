                You Never Tried
            </h1>
            <p> brown cotton sheets
                brush upon my skin
                come to lie down with me
                and feed the urges within
                
                stars glow upon our faces
                as i sink within your hold
                failing to see the traces
                of discomfort inside my soul

                atoms almost touching
                that's the closest we'll get 
                no seams between our clothing
                hearts beating together, zero offset

                I've dreamt this many times 
                white wall, eyes open wide

                static stare, he becomes aware
                refocused, I think this drink is mixed with lotus

                time passes and i knew it wouldn't last. 
                impassioned person, why do you torture yourself?
                I wish far beyond what's possible, perhaps--
                why don't you wish for someone else?

                Loyalty without passion
                living without meaning
                I make what is not
                I believe in what I'm dreaming
                cuz vision doesn't require seeing
                and being requires believing
                even with what is not
                I search for what can:

                brown sheets
                my skin
                you with me 
                feed urges within.
