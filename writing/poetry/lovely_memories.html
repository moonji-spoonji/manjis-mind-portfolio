                Lovely Memories
            </h1>
            <p> Sitting on the porch this morning with a cup of tea
                I saw passing by a now old, cozy memory
                Of you and myself talking long through the night
                Not a single issue between us to catalyze a fight.
                
                Your voice and literature so kind and warm 
                Could easily protect me through disastrous storms 
                And your eyes – so loving that the slightest 
                Would make a home out of a house missing a kitchen sink
                
                And it’s not just one moment i remember and treasure of us together
                But all my heartstrings you’ve plucked and with yours you’ve tethered
                That even if i were to be burnt to ash and scattered
                You and my faith would be all that ever mattered. 
                
                In the evening when i baked the pie you adored 
                I saw the scent path you followed with your nose past the bedroom door
                
                …
                
                All these beautifully bittersweet memories renewed and relived
                I will wait as long as it takes for our happily ever after again to begin. 
                
            </p>
