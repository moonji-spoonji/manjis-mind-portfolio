            Manji
        </h1>
        <p class="explain">
            Okay, let's be a little more real now. My name is Iman and my nickname is Manji or Moonji. Manji comes from Jumanji (congrats if you guessed it!) which was my OG nickname. Moonji is a variation that factors in my love for the moon. <br> 
            To put it simply, Iman means "faith" in Arabic. To be more precise, it means the trust, belief, and recognition of the existence of God. This is a neutral name, meaning both male and female babies can be given this name. Some famous examples are Iman Shumpert the basketball player, and Iman the model (and former wife of David Bowie). <br> 
            One time I looked up what "manji" could mean in other languages just in case I needed to do a lil reworking on dat nickname... but turns out it's a symbol representing strength and endurance. It was also often engraved on samurai swords. Sooo, I guess you could say that it's pretty legit and totally fits my personality.

                    I am a result of a biological process that I will never share on my webiste.
                    
                    But anywayyyy

                    This serves as a fun form of freative fexpression (i'm an alliteration genius) and I want to give those who may know me or not a lil peephole into the expanding mini-universe that is mah mind. 
                    <!-- <br> -->
                    I studied Computer Science in college (university) so I might as well do something related to it but like do something that actually interests me. 
                    <!-- <br> -->
                    I've been getting into copywriting recently and this will also function as a portfolio mayhaps. Hit me up if you want a brilliant, non-boujie, budget-friendly, bopywriter to beautify and boost your business. 
                    <!-- <br> -->
                    Also, I'm bored and words are one of my greatest passions after people, of course.
